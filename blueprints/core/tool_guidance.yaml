    examples:
      - "explore_topic_categories() - see all topic categories and their counts"
      - "explore_topic_categories(category='math_foundation') - see mathematical foundation topics"
    when_to_use: "When asked about research areas, topic distributions, or to understand the scope of concepts"

# Multi-tool usage patterns for common question types
usage_patterns:
  # Pattern for finding information about a specific concept
  concept_exploration:
    description: "How to thoroughly explore a research concept or topic"
    steps:
      1: "search_topics(concept_name) - find the concept in topic database"
      2: "reverse_discusses(target_type='topic', target_id=found_topic_id) - find papers discussing it"
      3: "search_chronicle_documents(concept_name) - find personal notes about it"
      4: "search_academic_documents(concept_name) - find relevant papers"
