## Langflow as an MCP Server Integration

Langflow can function as an MCP server, exposing its flows as tools for MCP clients. 

### Prerequisites:
- A Langflow project with at least one flow.
- Node.js installed (for MCP Inspector).
- ngrok installed (for public deployment).

### Exposing Flows as MCP Tools:
1. From the Langflow dashboard, select the project and go to the **MCP Server** tab.
2. Click **Edit Actions**.
3. Select the flows to expose as tools.
4. (Optional) Edit **Flow Name** and **Flow Description** for clarity (important for agentic use).

### Connecting Clients to Langflow's MCP Server:
- Copy the code template from the **MCP Server** tab in Langflow.
- Paste it into the client's `mcp.json` configuration file (e.g., Cursor).
- If authentication is required, include the Langflow API key.

### Testing and Debugging:
- Use MCP Inspector (`http://localhost:6274`) to monitor and test flows.
- Connect MCP Inspector to the Langflow MCP server's `sse` endpoint.

### Important Considerations:
- Clearly name and describe flows for agents to understand their purpose.
- Deploy publicly using ngrok if needed.



## Sequential Thinking MCP Server

The Sequential Thinking MCP server is an implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process. It helps break down complex problems into manageable steps, revise and refine thoughts, and branch into alternative reasoning paths.

### Features:
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps.
- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens.
- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning.
- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically.
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses.

### Tool: `sequential_thinking`

This tool facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.

**Inputs:**
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step.
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed.
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number.
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed.
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking.
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered.
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number.
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier.
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed.

### Usage with Claude Desktop / VS Code (Example Configurations):

**npx:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Docker:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To disable logging of thought information, set the environment variable `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` to `true`.

### Building Docker Image:
```shell
docker build -t mcp/sequentialthinking -f src/sequentialthinking/Dockerfile .
```





## Langflow as an MCP Client Integration

Langflow can also act as an MCP client, connecting to external MCP servers and using their tools within Langflow flows. This is done using the **MCP connection** component.

### Using the MCP Connection Component:
1. Add an **MCP connection** component to your flow.
2. **Stdio Mode (for external MCP servers):**
   - In the **MCP Command** field, enter the command to start the MCP server (e.g., `uvx mcp-server-fetch`).
   - Environment variables can be set in the **Env** fields or in Langflow's `.env` file.
   - Click **Refresh** to retrieve the list of tools.
3. **SSE Mode (for Langflow projects as MCP tools):**
   - Select **SSE** mode.
   - Modify the **MCP SSE URL** to point to your Langflow server's SSE endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:7860/api/v1/mcp/sse`).
   - Click to test the endpoint and refresh the **Tools** list.
4. Enable **Tool Mode** in the component's header menu.
5. Connect the **MCP connection** component's **Toolset** port to an **Agent** component's **Tools** port.
6. Test your flow in the Playground.

### Integrating Sequential Thinking MCP Server with Langflow (Client Side):

To integrate the Sequential Thinking MCP server with Langflow, you would use the **MCP connection** component in Langflow as a client. You would configure it to connect to your running Sequential Thinking MCP server.

**Steps:**
1. **Start the Sequential Thinking MCP Server:** You can run it using Docker or npx as described in the Sequential Thinking MCP Server section (e.g., `docker run --rm -i mcp/sequentialthinking`). Ensure the server is accessible from where your Langflow instance is running.
2. **Add MCP Connection Component in Langflow:** In your Langflow flow, add an **MCP connection** component.
3. **Configure MCP Connection Component:**
   - **Mode:** Choose **Stdio** if running the Sequential Thinking MCP server locally via a command, or **SSE** if it exposes an SSE endpoint.
   - **MCP Command (for Stdio mode):** If you're running the server directly, you might use a command like `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` (if Node.js and npx are available in the Langflow environment) or a custom script that launches your Docker container.
   - **MCP SSE URL (for SSE mode):** If the Sequential Thinking MCP server provides an SSE endpoint, enter its URL here.
4. **Refresh and Select Tool:** Click **Refresh** in the MCP connection component to discover the `sequential_thinking` tool.
5. **Connect to Agent:** Connect the **Toolset** output of the MCP connection component to the **Tools** input of an **Agent** component in your Langflow flow.
6. **Utilize in Agent Prompt:** Within your agent's prompt, you can then instruct it to use the `sequential_thinking` tool when appropriate. The agent will then call the tool with the necessary inputs (`thought`, `nextThoughtNeeded`, etc.) as it processes information sequentially.





## LangGraph MCP Integration

LangGraph agents can utilize tools defined on MCP servers through the `langchain-mcp-adapters` library. This package simplifies the integration of external MCP tools into LangGraph workflows.

### Key Steps for LangGraph Integration:
1. **Install `langchain-mcp-adapters`:**
   ```bash
   pip install langchain-mcp-adapters
   ```
2. **Configure `MultiServerMCPClient`:**
   - Import `MultiServerMCPClient` from `langchain_mcp_adapters.client`.
   - Initialize `MultiServerMCPClient` with a dictionary defining your MCP servers. Each server entry should include:
     - A unique name (e.g., "sequential-thinking").
     - `command` and `args` for `stdio` transport (e.g., `python /path/to/your_server.py`).
     - `url` and `transport` for `streamable_http` transport (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/mcp`).
   - Example for Sequential Thinking MCP Server (assuming it's running via Docker and exposed via HTTP, or you have a script to run it locally):
     ```python
     from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
     from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

     client = MultiServerMCPClient(
         {
             "sequential-thinking": {
                 "command": "docker", # Or "npx" if using npx package
                 "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "mcp/sequentialthinking"], # Or npx args
                 "transport": "stdio", # Or "streamable_http" if exposed via HTTP
             }
         }
     )
     tools = await client.get_tools()
     agent = create_react_agent(
         "anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", # Replace with your desired LLM
         tools
     )
     # Now you can invoke the agent with messages that might trigger the sequential_thinking tool
     response = await agent.ainvoke(
         {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Break down the problem of 'planning a trip' into sequential steps."}]}
     )
     ```
3. **Get Tools:** Call `client.get_tools()` to retrieve the tools exposed by the configured MCP servers.
4. **Integrate with LangGraph Agent:** Pass the retrieved tools to your LangGraph agent (e.g., using `create_react_agent`).
5. **Invoke Agent:** The LangGraph agent can then use the `sequential_thinking` tool based on its internal reasoning and the user's prompts.

### Considerations for Sequential Thinking MCP with LangGraph:
- Ensure the Sequential Thinking MCP server is running and accessible from your LangGraph environment.
- The `langchain-mcp-adapters` library handles the communication with the MCP server.
- The LangGraph agent will decide when to invoke the `sequential_thinking` tool based on its prompt and the problem it's trying to solve.
- You will need to manage the lifecycle of the Sequential Thinking MCP server (starting it before your LangGraph agent runs).





## Agent Interaction with MCP Servers

Agents, whether in Langflow or LangGraph, interact with MCP servers by dynamically selecting and utilizing the tools exposed by these servers. The core idea is that the agent, based on its internal reasoning and the task at hand, determines when and how to call an MCP tool.

### How Agents Use MCP Tools:

1.  **Tool Discovery:** When an MCP client (like Langflow's MCP Connection component or LangGraph's `MultiServerMCPClient`) connects to an MCP server, it discovers the available tools and their functionalities (inputs, outputs, descriptions). This information is crucial for the agent to understand what capabilities are at its disposal.

2.  **Reasoning and Selection:** The agent, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), receives a user query or a task. It then uses its reasoning capabilities to decide if any of the available MCP tools can help in solving the problem. This often involves analyzing the tool's description and inputs to see if they align with the current sub-problem.

3.  **Tool Invocation:** If the agent decides to use a tool, it constructs the necessary inputs for that tool based on the current context and the problem's requirements. The MCP client then sends this request to the MCP server, which executes the tool.

4.  **Result Integration:** The MCP server returns the result of the tool's execution to the MCP client. The agent then integrates this result back into its reasoning process, using it to formulate a response, take further actions, or refine its understanding of the problem.

### Example: Agent Using Sequential Thinking MCP Tool

Let's consider an agent tasked with a complex problem, such as "Develop a marketing strategy for a new product launch." This task can benefit from sequential thinking.

**Scenario:**

*   **User Prompt:** "Develop a marketing strategy for a new product launch, considering target audience, messaging, and channels."

*   **Agent's Internal Thought Process (Simplified):**
    *   "This is a complex task. I need to break it down into smaller, manageable steps. The `sequential_thinking` MCP tool seems appropriate for this."
    *   "I will invoke the `sequential_thinking` tool with an initial thought: 'Define the target audience.'"

*   **Tool Invocation (by MCP Client on behalf of Agent):**
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "sequential_thinking",
      "inputs": {
        "thought": "Define the target audience.",
        "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
        "thoughtNumber": 1,
        "totalThoughts": 3
      }
    }
    ```

*   **MCP Server Response:** The Sequential Thinking MCP server processes this and might return a confirmation or an updated state.

*   **Agent's Continued Reasoning:**
    *   "Now that I have defined the target audience, my next sequential thought should be 'Craft key messaging.'"
    *   The agent would then invoke the `sequential_thinking` tool again with the next thought.

This iterative process continues, with the agent using the `sequential_thinking` tool to guide its progress through the complex task. The agent doesn't directly 'know' how to perform sequential thinking; it delegates this structured thinking process to the MCP server via the tool.

### Key Takeaways for Agent Interaction:

*   **Tool Descriptions are Vital:** For effective agent interaction, the `Flow Name` and `Flow Description` in Langflow (when exposing flows as MCP servers) or the tool descriptions in other MCP servers are paramount. Agents rely on these descriptions to understand the purpose and usage of each tool.

*   **Dynamic Tool Use:** Agents don't have hardcoded logic for every task. Instead, they dynamically choose and use tools based on their understanding of the problem and the available toolset.

*   **Orchestration:** In frameworks like LangGraph, the agent's state machine orchestrates the calls to various tools, including MCP tools, to achieve the overall goal.
