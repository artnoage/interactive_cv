# Interactive CV Project - CLAUDE.md

## üöÄ Embedding-First Agent Overview

The Interactive CV uses a **unified tool agent** that leverages semantic search across all entities with advanced reasoning capabilities.

**Key Achievement**: *6 unified tools with semantic search + MCP integration replace 83+ specific tools*

### System Architecture

- **`interactive_agent.py`** - Main agent with 6 unified tools and semantic intelligence
- **Pep Talk Coach** - Motivational agent that prevents lazy responses and ensures tool usage
- **Blueprint Configuration** - YAML files define all domain knowledge for database building
- **Semantic Enhancement** - Hybrid SQL + embedding search for concept discovery
- **MCP Integration** - Real Model Context Protocol for structured reasoning
- **Centralized Profile** - Consistent biography from Profile/ directory

### The 6 Unified Tools

1. **`semantic_search`** - Search across ALL entity types using embeddings
   - Finds documents, topics, people, methods, institutions, applications, projects
   - Handles synonyms and name variations automatically
   - Returns relevance scores

2. **`navigate_relationships`** - Traverse the knowledge graph
   - Forward mode: Find what an entity points to (e.g., paper ‚Üí topics)
   - Reverse mode: Find what points to an entity (e.g., person ‚Üí papers)
   - Critical for multi-hop queries (e.g., person ‚Üí papers ‚Üí institutions)

3. **`get_entity_details`** - Get full information about any entity
   - Returns all attributes and content
   - Works with any entity type

4. **`list_available_papers`** - Paper catalog access
   - Shows complete list of papers in the system
   - Useful for understanding available research scope

5. **`consult_manuscript`** - Deep document analysis (META TOOL)
   - Manuscript Agent integration for original document access
   - Specialized multi-tool agent with file reading capabilities
   - Used when database search isn't detailed enough

6. **`sequential_reasoning`** - Structured analysis (META TOOL)
   - Real MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
   - Step-by-step reasoning for complex cross-domain questions
   - JSON-RPC communication with dedicated MCP server subprocess

### The Pep Talk Coach üéØ

A revolutionary **motivational coaching agent** that sits between the main agent and the user to ensure quality responses:

- **Intercepts lazy responses** - Catches "I'll search for..." and "I cannot find..." patterns
- **Provides motivational feedback** - Uses high-temperature generation for creative coaching
- **Enforces tool usage** - Won't let planning statements through without actual tool calls
- **Fallback reminders** - Specifically asks "Did you take into account the fallback info from the profile?"
- **Loop prevention** - Allows up to 4 coaching attempts before giving up
- **Dynamic messaging** - Each pep talk is contextually generated and unique

**Workflow**: User ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí **Pep Talk Coach** ‚Üí (Back to Agent if needed) ‚Üí User

This ensures the agent actually uses its tools instead of just talking about using them!

### Usage

```bash
# Run the interactive agent
python interactive_agent.py

# Use Claude for best instruction following (recommended)
AGENT_MODEL=claude python interactive_agent.py

# Use Flash for cost-effective performance with coaching
AGENT_MODEL=flash python interactive_agent.py

# Use Pro model for sophisticated analysis
AGENT_MODEL=pro python interactive_agent.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Commands

### Database Management

```bash
# Build database from scratch
python DB/build_database.py

# Incremental update (new documents only)
python DB/update_database.py

# Extract metadata using blueprints
python agents/extractor.py academic --input academic/ --output raw_data/academic/extracted_metadata/
python agents/extractor.py personal --input personal_notes/ --output raw_data/personal_notes/extracted_metadata/
```

### Chronicle Sync

```bash
chronicle              # Regular sync with metadata extraction
chronicle-dry          # Dry run
chronicle-force        # Force re-extraction
chronicle-status       # Check configuration
```

### Visualization

```bash
