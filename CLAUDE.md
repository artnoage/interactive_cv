# Interactive CV Project - CLAUDE.md

## üöÄ Embedding-First Agent Overview

The Interactive CV uses a **unified tool agent** that leverages semantic search across all entities with advanced reasoning capabilities.

**Key Achievement**: *6 unified tools with semantic search + MCP integration provide comprehensive functionality*

### System Architecture

- **`interactive_agent.py`** - Main agent with 6 unified tools and semantic intelligence
- **Pep Talk Coach** - Motivational agent that prevents lazy responses and ensures tool usage
- **Blueprint Configuration** - YAML files define all domain knowledge for database building
- **Semantic Enhancement** - Hybrid SQL + embedding search for concept discovery
- **MCP Integration** - Real Model Context Protocol for structured reasoning
- **Centralized Profile** - Consistent biography from Profile/ directory

### The 6 Unified Tools

1. **`semantic_search`** - Search across ALL entity types using embeddings
   - Finds documents, topics, people, methods, institutions, applications, projects
   - Handles synonyms and name variations automatically
   - Returns relevance scores

2. **`navigate_relationships`** - Traverse the knowledge graph
   - Forward mode: Find what an entity points to (e.g., paper ‚Üí topics)
   - Reverse mode: Find what points to an entity (e.g., person ‚Üí papers)
   - Critical for multi-hop queries (e.g., person ‚Üí papers ‚Üí institutions)

3. **`get_entity_details`** - Get full information about any entity
   - Returns all attributes and content
   - Works with any entity type

4. **`list_available_papers`** - Paper catalog access
   - Shows complete list of papers in the system
   - Useful for understanding available research scope

5. **`consult_manuscript`** - Deep document analysis (META TOOL)
   - Manuscript Agent integration for original document access
   - Specialized multi-tool agent with file reading capabilities
   - Used when database search isn't detailed enough

6. **`sequential_reasoning`** - Structured analysis (META TOOL)
   - Real MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
   - Step-by-step reasoning for complex cross-domain questions
   - JSON-RPC communication with dedicated MCP server subprocess

### The Pep Talk Coach üéØ

A **quality assurance agent** that intervenes ONLY when the agent provides truly non-informative responses:

- **Strict Intervention** - Only activates when answers have no useful information at all
- **Single Intervention** - Maximum of one pep talk per conversation to prevent loops
- **Answer Quality Focus** - Evaluates response content, not question patterns
- **General Guidance** - Provides actionable advice without seeing the original question
- **Non-Informative Detection** - Catches planning statements, generic IDs, error messages, very short responses

**Key Features**:
- Only triggers on truly empty or non-informative responses
- Eliminates coaching loops that could block good answers
- Maintains high quality scoring (e.g., risk-sensitive POMDP question scores 95/100)

**Evolution from v1 to v2**:
- **v1**: Intervened too frequently, sometimes blocking good answers
- **v2**: Smarter detection - only intervenes for truly non-informative responses
- **Result**: Better performance on complex questions without unnecessary interruptions

**Workflow**: User ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí **Quality Check** ‚Üí (Pep Talk if needed) ‚Üí User

This ensures quality responses without blocking legitimate answers that contain real information!

### Usage

```bash
# Run the interactive agent
python interactive_agent.py

# Use Claude for best instruction following (recommended)
AGENT_MODEL=claude python interactive_agent.py

# Use Flash for cost-effective performance with coaching
AGENT_MODEL=flash python interactive_agent.py

# Use Pro model for sophisticated analysis
AGENT_MODEL=pro python interactive_agent.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Commands

### Database Management

```bash
# Academic Paper Workflow (3 steps)
# 1. Analyze papers for deep insights
python agents/academic_analyzer.py --input academic/ --output raw_data/academic/generated_analyses/

# 2. Extract structured metadata from analyses
python agents/extractor.py academic --input raw_data/academic/generated_analyses/ --output raw_data/academic/extracted_metadata/

# 3. Build database from all metadata
python DB/build_database.py

# Personal Notes Workflow (2 steps)
# 1. Extract metadata directly from notes
python agents/extractor.py personal --input personal_notes/ --output raw_data/personal_notes/extracted_metadata/

# 2. Update database (if already built)
python DB/update_database.py
```

### Chronicle Sync

```bash
chronicle              # Regular sync with metadata extraction
chronicle-dry          # Dry run
chronicle-force        # Force re-extraction
chronicle-status       # Check configuration
```

### Visualization

```bash
# View database
./view_database.sh

# Generate knowledge graph
python KG/graph_builder.py DB/metadata.db --output KG/knowledge_graph.json

# Launch unified UI
./start_ui.sh
./start_ui.sh --with-datasette
```

## üéØ Profile Setup

1. The system includes a **built-in profile** for Vaios Laschos:
   - Profile is embedded in `Profile/profile_loader.py` for reliability
   - No manual setup required - works out of the box
   - Includes complete identity, research expertise, and professional experience
   - To customize: Edit the `prompt_content` in `ProfileLoader._load_agent_prompt()`

2. The agent automatically loads this built-in profile - fully self-contained
