# Interactive Agent Improvement Roadmap

## Current State
The interactive agent is functional after fixing threading issues and enhancing content retrieval. However, there are several areas where it could be significantly improved to provide more accurate and comprehensive answers.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Implement True Semantic Search
**Current Issue**: Using SQL LIKE queries which miss semantically related content
**Solution**: 
- Use the existing embeddings in the database for similarity search
- Implement cosine similarity search using the `embeddings` table
- Create a new tool that leverages vector similarity instead of text matching

### 2. Enhanced Answer Synthesis
**Current Issue**: Agent sometimes provides general knowledge instead of specific paper details
**Solution**:
- Add a validation step that checks if retrieved content actually answers the question
- Implement a "confidence score" for answers based on retrieved content relevance
- Add fallback strategies when initial searches don't yield results

### 3. Improved Tool Chaining Strategy
**Current Issue**: Agent doesn't effectively chain multiple tools for complex questions
**Solution**:
- Add a "query planner" that breaks down complex questions into sub-queries
- Implement a workflow for comparison questions:
  1. Search for first topic
  2. Search for second topic
  3. Extract relevant sections
  4. Synthesize comparison
- Add memory of previous tool results within a conversation

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 4. Context Window Optimization
**Current Issue**: Fixed context lengths may miss important information
**Solution**:
- Implement dynamic context sizing based on query complexity
- Add ability to retrieve multiple overlapping chunks for comprehensive coverage
- Create a "context aggregator" that merges related chunks intelligently

### 5. Entity-Aware Search
**Current Issue**: Not leveraging the rich entity relationships in the knowledge graph
**Solution**:
- Create tools that traverse entity relationships (e.g., "find all papers by authors who worked on topic X")
- Implement graph-based search that follows relationship chains
- Add entity disambiguation when multiple matches exist

### 6. Question Understanding Enhancement
**Current Issue**: Complex questions may not be parsed optimally
**Solution**:
- Add question classification (comparison, definition, evolution, etc.)
- Implement query expansion using the knowledge graph
- Add support for follow-up questions that reference previous context

## Low Priority (But Valuable) Improvements

### 7. Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Pre-compute common query patterns
- Implement parallel tool execution for independent searches

### 8. Answer Formatting
- Add structured output formats (tables for comparisons, timelines for evolution)
- Include confidence indicators in responses
- Add citation formatting with specific page/section references

### 9. Proactive Information Retrieval
- Suggest related topics based on query
- Provide "did you know" facts from related papers
- Offer to explore adjacent research areas

## Implementation Priority

1. **Semantic Search** (Critical) - Would dramatically improve answer quality
2. **Tool Chaining** (High) - Essential for complex questions
3. **Answer Synthesis** (High) - Reduces hallucination risk
4. **Entity-Aware Search** (Medium) - Leverages existing graph structure
5. **Context Optimization** (Medium) - Improves completeness

## Technical Requirements

### For Semantic Search Implementation:
```python
def semantic_search_embeddings(query: str, top_k: int = 5):
    # 1. Generate embedding for query
    query_embedding = generate_embedding(query)
    
    # 2. Query embeddings table with cosine similarity
    results = conn.execute("""
        SELECT e.entity_id, e.entity_type, 
               (embeddings <-> ?) as similarity
        FROM embeddings e
        ORDER BY similarity
        LIMIT ?
    """, (query_embedding, top_k))
    
    # 3. Retrieve full content for matched entities
    # 4. Return ranked results
```

### For Tool Chaining:
```python
class QueryPlanner:
    def plan_query(self, question: str) -> List[ToolCall]:
        # Analyze question type
        # Break into sub-queries
        # Return ordered list of tool calls
```

## Metrics for Success

- **Answer Accuracy**: Compare against Q&A test set
- **Response Time**: Maintain < 5 second response time
- **Coverage**: Percentage of questions answered with specific content
- **User Satisfaction**: Track which answers require follow-up clarification

## Next Steps

1. Implement semantic search using existing embeddings
2. Create comprehensive test suite with expected answers
3. Add query planning for complex questions
4. Implement confidence scoring for answers
5. Optimize tool execution patterns

This roadmap would transform the agent from a functional prototype to a production-ready system capable of providing accurate, detailed answers about the research corpus.
