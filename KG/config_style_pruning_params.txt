# Config-Style Knowledge Graph Pruning Parameters
# Used to create web_ui/knowledge_graph.json from KG/knowledge_graph.json
# Date: 2025-01-04

## Command Used:
python KG/prune_knowledge_graph.py KG/knowledge_graph.json web_ui/knowledge_graph.json \
--exclude-entities person personal_achievement personal_learning personal_note challenge future_direction assumption limitation general_concept general_topic theoretical_method analytical_method algorithmic_method computational_method general_method tool project math_foundation \
--exclude-relationships accomplished learned plans faced_challenge mentions relates_to suggests_future_work makes_assumption has_limitation discovered discovers affiliated_with authored_by proves \
--remove-isolated

## Rationale:

### Entity Types Excluded (18 types):
- person                    # Remove individual people (not in config.json style)
- personal_achievement      # Remove personal elements
- personal_learning         # Remove personal elements  
- personal_note            # Remove personal elements
- challenge                # Remove personal elements
- future_direction         # Remove planning/process details
- assumption               # Remove research process metadata
- limitation               # Remove research process metadata
- general_concept          # Remove vague/general categorizations
- general_topic            # Remove vague/general categorizations
- theoretical_method       # Remove detailed method categorizations
- analytical_method        # Remove detailed method categorizations
- algorithmic_method       # Remove detailed method categorizations
- computational_method     # Remove detailed method categorizations
- general_method           # Remove detailed method categorizations
- tool                     # Remove implementation details
- project                  # Remove project-specific elements
- math_foundation          # Remove detailed mathematical concepts (too technical for config-style)

### Entity Types Kept (6 types):
- paper                    # Core academic content (matches config.json)
- research_insight         # Key research concepts (≈ ml_concept in config.json)
- research_area            # Research domains (≈ ml_concept in config.json)
- innovation               # Key innovations (≈ ml_concept in config.json)
- application              # Real-world uses (matches config.json)
- institution              # Academic institutions (matches config.json)

### Relationship Types Excluded (14 types):
- accomplished             # Personal achievement process
- learned                  # Personal learning process
- plans                    # Future planning process
- faced_challenge          # Personal challenge process
- mentions                 # Vague/weak connections
- relates_to               # Vague/weak connections
- suggests_future_work     # Research process metadata
- makes_assumption         # Research process metadata
- has_limitation           # Research process metadata
- discovered               # Research process details
- discovers                # Research process details
- affiliated_with          # Person-institution connections (removed people)
- authored_by              # Person-paper connections (removed people)
- proves                   # Theoretical proof relationships (too formal for config-style)

### Relationship Types Kept (3 types):
- discusses                # Core research activity (≈ investigates in config.json)
- innovates                # Innovation relationships (≈ develops in config.json)
- has_application          # Application connections (exact match with config.json)

## Results:
- Original: 1,081 entities, 1,247 relationships
- Pruned:   119 entities, 139 relationships  
- Retention: 11.0% entities, 11.1% relationships
- Isolated nodes removed: 110 (48% of intermediate result)

## Bug Fix Applied:
- Fixed phantom document references in graph_builder.py
- Issue: Edges referenced 'document_academic_1' but nodes were 'academic_1'
- Solution: Corrected ID mapping for document type relationships
- Result: 139 valid edges (was 0 before fix)

## Isolated Node Removal:
- Added --remove-isolated flag to pruning script
- Removes nodes with no connections (isolated nodes)
- Cleaned up 110 isolated nodes (48% of intermediate graph)
- Result: 100% connected graph with no orphaned entities

## Philosophy Achieved:
- Structural focus (like config.json) vs process focus (original KG)
- Core academic concepts only
- Clean, minimal relationship types
- Foundation-oriented rather than workflow-oriented
