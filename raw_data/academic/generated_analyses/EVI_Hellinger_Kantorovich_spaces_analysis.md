## Executive Summary

This paper establishes a comprehensive existence and uniqueness theory for gradient flows on the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) and Spherical Hellinger-Kantorovich (SHK) spaces. These spaces model transport processes where mass is not conserved, leading to reaction-diffusion type partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors study the convergence of the Minimizing Movement (MM) scheme, a time-discretization method, for geodesically λ-convex energy functionals. The standard convergence theory for gradient flows is not applicable because the HK and SHK spaces lack global geometric regularity (specifically, the squared distance is not globally semiconcave).

The core contribution is a novel two-pronged approach. First, the authors develop an abstract existence theorem for Evolutionary Variational Inequalities (EVI) that weakens the global semiconcavity assumption. It only requires that the space can be approximated by a nested sequence of subsets on which the squared distance is semiconcave (a 'local κ-concavity' property). Second, they prove a crucial technical result: the iterates of the MM scheme for HK and SHK spaces remain within these well-behaved subsets. Specifically, they establish a priori density bounds for the measures generated by the scheme, ensuring that if the initial measure has a bounded density, all subsequent measures in the scheme will also have bounded densities. Combining these results, the paper proves that the sequence of curves generated by the MM scheme converges to a unique EVI solution, thereby establishing a well-posedness theory for a class of nonlinear, and potentially degenerate, reaction-diffusion equations.

## Phase 1: Rapid Reconnaissance

### Problem Addressed
The paper addresses the problem of establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for gradient flows, formulated as Evolutionary Variational Inequalities (EVIs), on the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) and Spherical Hellinger-Kantorovich (SHK) metric spaces. Standard existence theories for EVIs (e.g., from [AGS05]) fail in this setting because these spaces are not sufficiently regular; in particular, the squared distance function is not globally semiconcave. This lack of geometric regularity prevents the direct application of established methods for proving the convergence of the Minimizing Movement (MM) scheme.

### Core Contribution
The main contribution is the proof of existence and uniqueness of EVI solutions for a class of geodesically λ-convex functionals on the HK and SHK spaces. This is achieved by developing a new theoretical framework that circumvents the lack of global geometric regularity. The key innovations are: (1) An abstract existence theorem for EVI solutions that only requires local semiconcavity of the squared distance on a dense collection of subsets. (2) A detailed analysis of the MM scheme on HK and SHK spaces, proving that the scheme propagates density bounds, thereby ensuring the iterates remain within the required well-behaved subsets where local semiconcavity holds.

### Initial Assessment
This is a high-quality, technically deep, and credible research paper in the field of mathematical analysis, specifically the theory of gradient flows in metric spaces. The authors are established experts in the field. The work addresses a significant open problem and provides a novel and rigorous solution. The methodology is sound, extending existing theories to a more challenging setting. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates its contributions, its connection to prior work, and its limitations.

### Claimed Contributions
- Proving that the sequence of curves from the Minimizing Movement (MM) scheme converges to a curve satisfying the Evolutionary Variational Inequality (EVI) for geodesically semiconvex functionals on HK and SHK spaces.
- Establishing a global EVI flow on the whole space under suitable conditions.
- Developing an abstract existence theorem for EVI solutions that relies on local κ-concavity of the squared distance, extending the approach of [MuS20, MuS23] to situations where this property is not global.
- Proving that if the initial measure in the MM scheme has favorable density bounds, the subsequent minimizers also exhibit favorable density bounds, which is crucial for applying the local concavity theory.
- Providing a clear comparison between the EVI approach, which guarantees uniqueness, and weak PDE solutions, for which uniqueness may fail.

### Structure Overview
The paper is organized into six main sections and an appendix. Section 1 introduces the problem, defines the key concepts (HK/SHK spaces, MM scheme, EVI), and states the main result. Section 2 contrasts the EVI formulation with the traditional PDE approach. Section 3 provides necessary background on the HK and SHK metric spaces. Section 4 contains the crucial technical proofs of density bounds for the MM scheme. Section 5 develops the abstract existence theory for EVI solutions based on local κ-concavity, adapting results from [MuS23]. Section 6 applies the abstract theory from Section 5 and the density bounds from Section 4 to prove the main theorem for HK and SHK spaces. The Appendix provides a technical result on transferring geodesic convexity from the HK space to the SHK space.

### Key Findings
- The Minimizing Movement (MM) scheme for geodesically λ-convex functionals on (M(X), HK) and (P(X), SHK) converges to a unique EVIλ solution.
- The iterates of the MM scheme on HK and SHK spaces preserve density bounds. For SHK, if the initial density ρ⁰ is in [c_min, c_max], all subsequent densities ρⁿ remain in [c_min, c_max]. For HK, the bounds evolve but can be controlled over finite time horizons.
- The existence of EVI solutions can be established under a weaker geometric assumption of 'local κ-concavity', where the squared distance is κ-concave only on a nested sequence of subsets whose union is dense in the domain of the functional.
- The HK and SHK spaces satisfy the Local Angle Condition (LAC) and the required local κ-concavity property on sets of measures with bounded densities (M_δ(X)).
- The EVI formulation provides a unique solution, resolving ambiguities present in weak PDE formulations of the corresponding reaction-diffusion equations, which can have non-unique solutions.
- For certain negative power-law functionals (E(c) = -c^q), geodesic convexity on (M(X), HK) can be transferred to geodesic convexity on (P(X), SHK).

## Research Context

**Historical Context**: The study of gradient flows in metric spaces was pioneered by De Giorgi and further developed in the seminal work of Ambrosio, Gigli, and Savaré ([AGS05]) for the Wasserstein space, connecting the Fokker-Planck equation to the gradient flow of entropy. This framework was extended to unbalanced transport and reaction-diffusion systems through the introduction of the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) distance by multiple groups ([CP*15], [KMV16b], [LMS16]).

**Current State**: Prior to this work, existence of solutions for the PDEs corresponding to HK/SHK gradient flows was studied using various methods, including PDE techniques ([KMV16a]), time-splitting schemes ([GaM17]), and convergence of the JKO scheme to weak PDE solutions ([Fle21]). However, a complete theory based on the intrinsic metric geometry of HK/SHK, particularly one guaranteeing uniqueness via the EVI formulation, was missing due to the geometric challenges of these spaces.

**Prior Limitations**: The main limitation of prior theory was the inapplicability of the standard [AGS05] framework for proving EVI existence. This framework relies on the λ-convexity of the functional `v -> d(w,v)²/(2τ) + E(v)`, which fails for HK and SHK. The alternative theory by Savaré and Muratori ([Sav07, MuS20, MuS23]) required global κ-concavity of the squared distance, a property that HK and SHK spaces do not possess. This paper overcomes these limitations.

**Advancement**: This paper advances the field by (1) generalizing the EVI existence theory to handle only local κ-concavity and (2) proving that the HK/SHK spaces and the associated MM schemes fit precisely into this new, weaker framework. This provides the first EVI-based well-posedness result for these important gradient systems.

## Methodology Analysis

### Key Technical Innovations
- Localization of the EVI existence proof: The paper adapts the theory from [MuS23] to a setting where the required geometric property (κ-concavity of the squared distance) holds only on a sequence of subsets Aκ that approximate the full domain. This is a significant methodological generalization.
- Propagation of density bounds for the MM scheme: The detailed analysis in Section 4, which shows that minimizers of the JKO-type scheme inherit density bounds, is a key technical innovation. This is achieved by constructing clever counter-examples that show a violation of the bounds would contradict the minimality of the solution.
- Discrete maximum principle for SHK: The proof of density bounds for the SHK case (Proposition 4.4) establishes a form of discrete maximum principle for the MM scheme, showing that the essential supremum of the density does not increase and the essential infimum does not decrease.

### Mathematical Framework
- The paper is set within the framework of metric gradient systems (X, φ, d), where X is a geodesic metric space, φ is a lower semicontinuous functional, and d is the metric.
- The core of the analysis uses the theory of Evolutionary Variational Inequalities (EVI) as a definition for gradient flows.
- It heavily relies on the geometric properties of the underlying metric space, specifically the Local Angle Condition (LAC) and the (local) κ-semiconcavity of the squared distance function.
- The analysis of the MM scheme uses techniques from the calculus of variations and optimal transport, including the construction of competitor measures and the use of transport-growth couples.

## Domain-Specific Analysis (Mathematics)

### Proof Strategy
The overall proof strategy is to establish the convergence of the Minimizing Movement (MM) scheme to an EVI solution. Since standard theories do not apply, the authors devise a multi-step plan: 1. Generalize the abstract EVI existence theorem from [MuS23] to only require 'local' κ-concavity on a dense union of sets (Theorem 5.9). 2. Prove that the HK and SHK spaces possess this local κ-concavity on sets of measures with bounded densities (Theorem 6.1, citing [LaM19]). 3. Prove that the iterates of the MM scheme, starting from an initial measure with bounded density, remain within these sets of bounded density for any finite time (Propositions 4.2, 4.3, 4.4). 4. Combine these results to show that for initial data with bounded density, the MM scheme converges to an EVI solution. 5. Use a density argument to extend the existence and uniqueness result to all initial data in the functional's domain.

### Key Lemmas
Key lemmas include Lemma 4.1, which establishes a fundamental property of the optimal transport-growth couple (ρ₁(T(x)) ≤ ρ₁(x)), and the series of estimates in Section 5.5 (Lemma 5.13, Proposition 5.14, Lemma 5.17) that control the error between the geodesic interpolants of the MM scheme and a true EVI solution. Lemma 3.8, on the decomposition of the HK cost, is also crucial for the 'cut-and-paste' arguments in Section 4.

### Potential Gaps
The paper is rigorous and self-contained, with one notable exception: it heavily relies on results from [MuS23], a work cited as 'in preparation'. While the authors state the necessary theorems and propositions clearly, a full verification of those steps would require access to the cited work. This is a common practice in fast-moving research areas but represents a formal dependency. The authors explicitly acknowledge this and provide proofs for the parts that are their own extension (i.e., the localization argument).

## Critical Examination

### Assumptions
- The base space X is a compact, convex subset of R^d with a non-empty interior. This is crucial for the characterization of geodesics and the properties of transport-growth couples.
- The energy functional E is of the form (1.1), an integral of a function E of the density plus a term for the singular part.
- The density function E: R⁺ → R is convex and the overall functional E is geodesically λ-convex for some λ ∈ R. This is a strong structural assumption that restricts the class of applicable PDEs.
- The transport map T in the optimal transport-growth couple is assumed to be injective, which is justified by results in [LMS23] for the given setting.

### Limitations
- The characterization of geodesically λ-convex functionals on the SHK space is incomplete. The paper provides some examples but notes that a general characterization is an open problem.
- The analysis is restricted to base spaces X that are compact and convex subsets of R^d. Extension to more general metric spaces would be a non-trivial future work.
- The reliance on the 'in preparation' manuscript [MuS23] for several key theoretical results in Section 5 is a limitation on the paper's self-containedness.

### Evidence Quality
- The evidence is entirely based on mathematical proofs. The arguments are detailed, technical, and appear to be correct. The logic is built step-by-step, with clear references to prior work and explicit statements of new results. The use of illustrative examples (Section 5.4) and a comparison to the PDE perspective (Section 2) strengthens the paper's clarity and impact.

## Phase 2: Deep Dive - Technical Content

### Mathematical Concepts
- **Hellinger-Kantorovich space (M(X), HK)** (Category: space): A geodesic metric space of non-negative finite Borel measures on X. The HK distance (also called Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao) interpolates between the Wasserstein distance (transport) and the Hellinger distance (mass creation/destruction), modeling unbalanced optimal transport.
- **Spherical Hellinger-Kantorovich space (P(X), SHK)** (Category: space): A geodesic metric space of probability measures on X. Its distance is derived from the HK distance via a sphericalization `SHK = 2 arcsin(HK/2)`, making P(X) a 'spherical' version of a subset of M(X).
- **Evolutionary Variational Inequality (EVI)** (Category: equation): A formulation of gradient flows in metric spaces. A curve x(t) is an EVIλ solution if `d/dt (d(x(t), x_ob)²/2) + λ/2 d(x(t), x_ob)² ≤ φ(x_ob) - φ(x(t))` for any observer `x_ob`. It implies uniqueness and contraction properties.
- **Minimizing Movement (MM) scheme** (Category: method): A time-discretization procedure for constructing gradient flows, also known as the JKO scheme. It generates a sequence of points by iteratively solving a minimization problem: `x_n = argmin {d(x, x_{n-1})²/(2τ) + φ(x)}`.
- **Geodesic λ-convexity / κ-concavity** (Category: property): A generalization of convexity/concavity to functions on a geodesic metric space. A function φ is λ-convex if `t -> φ(γ(t)) - λt²/2` is convex for any geodesic γ. κ-concavity is defined analogously.
- **Local Angle Condition (LAC)** (Category: property): A geometric property of a metric space at a point x. It states that for any three geodesics emanating from x, the sum of the upper angles between them is at most 2π. It is a weak form of non-positive curvature.
- **Metric Gradient System** (Category: framework): A triplet (X, φ, d) consisting of a metric space, a lower semicontinuous functional, and a distance, which forms the basis for defining a gradient flow.
- **Transport-growth couple** (Category: framework): A pair (q, T) that describes the transformation from a measure µ₀ to µ₁ in the HK setting. T is a transport map, and q is a growth/decay factor, such that µ₁ is the pushforward of q²µ₀ under T.
- **Logarithmic-Entropy Transport (LET) formulation** (Category: functional): A static variational formulation for the squared HK distance, involving a transport cost and relative entropy terms that penalize deviations from the original measures.
- **Metric slope |∂φ|** (Category: operator): A generalization of the norm of the gradient for a functional φ on a metric space. It measures the steepest local rate of decrease of φ.
- **Upper Dini derivative** (Category: operator): A generalization of the derivative for non-differentiable functions, defined as `limsup_{h->0⁺} (ζ(t+h) - ζ(t))/h`.

### Methods
- **Minimizing Movement (MM) Scheme** (Type: algorithmic): Used to construct discrete approximations of the EVI solution by iteratively solving a variational problem that balances minimizing the energy functional and moving a small distance.
- **Geodesic Interpolation** (Type: analytical): Used to construct continuous-time curves from the discrete points generated by the MM scheme. The convergence of these interpolated curves is the main object of study.
- **Calculus of Variations** (Type: theoretical): The core of the MM scheme and the analysis of density bounds relies on constructing competitor measures and showing they lead to a contradiction with the minimality of the solution.
- **Localization Argument** (Type: theoretical): A key methodological contribution where the global requirement of κ-concavity is replaced by a local one on a dense union of subsets, combined with a proof that the dynamics are confined to these subsets.
- **Metric Geometry Analysis** (Type: theoretical): The proof of convergence relies on abstract geometric properties of the space, namely the Local Angle Condition (LAC) and the κ-concavity of the squared distance, and their interplay with the λ-convexity of the energy functional.

### Algorithms
- **Minimizing Movement (MM) Scheme** (Purpose: To generate a sequence of measures (µ_n^τ) that approximates the solution to the EVI / gradient flow.)
  - Key Idea: At each time step n, find the measure µ_n^τ that minimizes the functional `F(µ) = d(µ, µ_{n-1}^τ)² / (2τ) + E(µ)`. This is a discrete version of steepest descent.
  - Complexity: The complexity of each step involves solving a non-convex optimization problem over a space of measures, which is generally computationally intractable. The algorithm is used here as a theoretical tool for proving existence, not for practical computation.

## Critical Analysis Elements

## Evaluation & Validation

**Evaluation Approach**: The paper's claims are validated through rigorous mathematical proofs rather than empirical evaluation. The core of the validation lies in proving theorems that establish the convergence of the MM scheme and the existence/uniqueness of EVI solutions. The framework is tested against illustrative examples and counterexamples (Section 5.4) to build intuition and demonstrate the necessity of the assumptions.

## Proof Scrutiny (for Mathematical Papers)

**Proof Strategy**: The main proof (Theorem 6.6) combines the abstract existence result (Theorem 5.9) with the specific properties of HK/SHK spaces. The strategy is to verify the assumptions of Theorem 5.9. (A1) Local κ-concavity and LAC are cited from [LaM19] and re-established in Theorem 6.1. (A2) The property that the MM scheme iterates remain in the 'good' sets (M_δ(X)) is the main technical contribution of Section 4. (A3) The density of measures with bounded density in the domain of E is a standard result. Once these assumptions are verified, the conclusion of Theorem 5.9 gives convergence for initial data with bounded density, which is then extended to general initial data by an approximation argument.

**Key Lemmas**: Lemma 4.1 (ρ₁(T(x)) ≤ ρ₁(x)) is fundamental for the 'cut-and-paste' arguments in the density bound proofs. The estimates in Section 5.5, particularly Lemma 5.17 which controls the error term `Δ^τ` in the discrete EVI, are crucial for proving that the sequence of interpolated curves is a Cauchy sequence.

**Potential Gaps**: The main formal gap is the reliance on the preprint [MuS23] for the abstract EVI theory in Section 5. The authors are transparent about this, and the logic of how they apply and extend these results is laid out clearly.

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Future Work

### Key Insights
- The EVI framework is the 'correct' notion of gradient flow for HK/SHK spaces, as it provides a unique solution even when the corresponding PDE is ill-posed (non-unique).
- The crucial geometric properties required for EVI theory (like semiconcavity of d²) do not need to hold globally. It is sufficient for them to hold on a dense collection of subsets, as long as the dynamics of the flow are confined to these subsets.
- The MM scheme on HK/SHK spaces has a regularizing effect on densities, or at least a controlling one. It prevents densities from becoming arbitrarily high or low over finite time, which is the key to keeping the dynamics within the geometrically 'well-behaved' regions of the space.
- There is a deep connection between the geometry of the metric space (LAC, κ-concavity), the analytic properties of the functional (λ-convexity), and the behavior of the resulting dynamical system (EVI flow).
- The distinction between the HK space (unconstrained mass) and the SHK space (constrained mass) leads to qualitatively different behavior in the MM scheme's density bounds: SHK exhibits a true maximum principle, while HK bounds are weaker and evolve in time.

### Future Work
- Develop a general characterization of geodesically semiconvex functionals on the Spherical Hellinger-Kantorovich space. This is explicitly stated as Open Question 1.5.
- Investigate the relationship between the unique EVI solutions constructed in this paper and the weak PDE solutions obtained by other methods (e.g., [Fle21]).
- Extend the analysis to more general base spaces X beyond compact, convex subsets of Euclidean space.
- Apply the developed framework to a broader class of energy functionals and their corresponding reaction-diffusion systems in physics, biology, and other sciences.
- Study the long-term behavior of the EVI solutions, such as convergence to steady states and rates of convergence.

### Practical Implications
- Provides a solid mathematical foundation for models of biological phenomena like tumor growth and population dynamics, which involve both cell migration (transport) and proliferation/death (mass change).
- The uniqueness result is critical for practical applications, as it ensures that a given model has a single, predictable outcome, which is essential for simulation and analysis.
- The theoretical framework could guide the development of robust numerical schemes for simulating these complex reaction-diffusion systems, by building on the structure of the MM scheme.

### Connections to Other Work
**Builds On**:
- [LMS16, LMS18, LMS23] (Liero, Mielke, Savaré): This series of papers established the fundamental properties of the HK space, its geodesics, and the geodesic convexity of certain functionals, laying the groundwork.
- [LaM19] (Laschos, Mielke): This paper introduced the SHK space and proved the key geometric properties (LAC and local semiconcavity) that are essential for the current work.
- [MuS20, MuS23] (Muratori, Savaré): This work developed the abstract EVI theory based on LAC and global κ-concavity, which the authors adapt and extend to the local setting.
- [Sav07, Sav11] (Savaré): This work initiated the EVI existence theory based on geometric conditions like LAC and semiconcavity, providing the foundation for [MuS20, MuS23].
- [JKO98] (Jordan, Kinderlehrer, Otto): This seminal paper introduced the MM/JKO scheme for the Wasserstein space, establishing the gradient flow structure of the Fokker-Planck equation.

**Related To**:
- [Fle21] (Fleißner): This work also studies the convergence of the JKO scheme for HK, but proves convergence to weak PDE solutions rather than EVI solutions. The authors expect the solutions to coincide.
- [KMV16b], [GaM17], [DiC20]: These papers study gradient flows and PDEs related to the HK distance using different techniques (classical PDE methods, splitting schemes), providing context and motivation for the EVI-based approach.

## Thinking Patterns Observed

**Systems Thinking**: The paper treats the evolution equation as a 'metric gradient system' (X, φ, d), analyzing the interplay between the components: the geometry of the space (d), the energy landscape (φ), and the resulting dynamics. The solution is a property of the entire system, not just the PDE in isolation.

**Abstraction And Generalization**: A key part of the methodology is to abstract the problem away from the specific HK/SHK spaces. The authors prove a general theorem (Thm 5.9) for metric spaces with 'local κ-concavity' and then show that HK/SHK are instances of this abstract class. This makes the result more powerful and potentially applicable elsewhere.

**Problem Decomposition**: The complex problem of proving EVI existence is broken down into more manageable sub-problems: (1) developing the abstract theory for local concavity, (2) proving the necessary density bounds for the MM scheme, and (3) verifying the geometric properties of the spaces. The final proof then assembles the solutions to these sub-problems.

## Quality Assessment

**Coherence**: The paper is highly coherent. Each section builds logically on the previous ones, leading systematically to the main result. The introduction clearly lays out the motivation, challenges, and the authors' strategy, which is then followed precisely throughout the paper.

**Completeness**: The paper is very complete in its arguments. Proofs are detailed, and necessary background is either provided or clearly cited. The authors are transparent about their reliance on results from a manuscript in preparation, which is the only minor point against full completeness.

**Bias**: The paper shows no discernible bias. It is a work of pure mathematics, and the claims are supported by rigorous proof. It fairly cites related and competing approaches to the same problem.
