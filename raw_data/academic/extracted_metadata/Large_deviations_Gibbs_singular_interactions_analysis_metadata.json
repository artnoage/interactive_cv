  "core_contribution": "The paper establishes Large Deviation Principles (LDPs) for the empirical measures of n-particle systems governed by Gibbs distributions. It significantly generalizes existing results by allowing for highly irregular potentials (singular, discontinuous, and weakly confining) and by proving the LDPs in stronger Wasserstein-type topologies. This is achieved using a unified framework based on the weak convergence approach.",
  "problem_addressed": "The paper addresses the problem of establishing a rigorous Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of a system of n interacting particles whose configuration is drawn from a Gibbs distribution. The core challenge is to prove such a principle under very general, and physically relevant, conditions on the interaction and confining potentials, which may be singular, discontinuous, or only weakly confining. Prior works required stronger regularity or confinement assumptions, limiting their scope.",
  "initial_assessment": "The paper is of high quality and credibility. The authors are leading experts in probability theory and large deviations. The work addresses fundamental problems in statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, and its contributions are significant, as it generalizes previous major results and resolves several open questions posed in the literature (e.g., by Chafaï et al.). The methodology is sophisticated and the results are clearly articulated and well-supported by rigorous proofs and illustrative examples.",
