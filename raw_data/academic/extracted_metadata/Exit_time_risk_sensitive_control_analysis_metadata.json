  "core_contribution": "The paper establishes two main results for a many-agent exit time stochastic control problem with a risk-sensitive cost. First, under a specific structural assumption on the control cost function (that uC'(u)-u is increasing), the complex risk-sensitive problem is shown to be equivalent to a simpler risk-neutral stochastic control problem for any finite number of agents. Second, as the number of agents tends to infinity, the value functions of these stochastic problems are proven to converge to the value function of a deterministic control problem, providing a tractable method for designing nearly optimal controls for large systems.",
  "problem_addressed": "The paper addresses the problem of optimally controlling a large system of cooperative agents that evolve as a Markov jump process. The goal is to maximize the time the system spends in a desirable region of the state space while minimizing a cost associated with control actions. The problem is formulated with a risk-sensitive cost criterion, which penalizes not just the expected cost but also its variability. The core challenges are the high dimensionality of the state space and the complexity of the risk-sensitive objective.",
  "initial_assessment": "The paper is a high-quality, technically deep contribution to the fields of stochastic control and mean-field systems. The authors are established experts. The problem formulation is clear and well-motivated. The main results—the equivalence of risk-sensitive and risk-neutral problems under specific conditions, and the convergence to a deterministic limit—are significant and non-trivial. The mathematical arguments are rigorous, detailed, and follow a logical structure, with clear statements of assumptions and theorems. The paper appears highly credible and relevant for researchers in control theory, applied probability, and multi-agent systems.",
