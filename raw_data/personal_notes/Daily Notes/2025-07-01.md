# Daily Note - 2025-07-01

## üéØ Today's Goals
- [x] Complete Interactive CV metadata system implementation
- [x] Implement document chunking for academic papers
- [x] Set up embeddings with OpenAI API
- [x] Test semantic search functionality

## üìù Notes

### Morning Thoughts
Started the day with a question about continuing the Interactive CV project. The plan from previous work was clear - implement the metadata system infrastructure.

### Interactive CV Major Implementation

Successfully completed the core metadata system:

1. **SQLite Database Setup**
   - Created comprehensive schema with documents, chunks, topics, people, projects
   - Added document_chunks table for granular academic paper sections
   - 113 chunks created from 12 academic papers

2. **Embeddings Implementation**
   - Integrated OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
   - Stored embeddings as BLOBs in SQLite (efficient and portable)
   - All documents and chunks now have vector embeddings

3. **Semantic Search Working**
   - Implemented cosine similarity search at both document and chunk level
   - Tested queries successfully find relevant academic sections and daily notes
   - Cross-domain search connects research papers with practical work

4. **File Organization**
   - Everything stored in single SQLite database (`metadata_system/metadata.db`)
   - No separate chunk files - all in database for efficiency
   - Clean structure maintained in metadata_system folder

### Key Accomplishments
- ‚úÖ Chunked all academic papers into 113 searchable sections
- ‚úÖ Generated embeddings for all content (6 chronicle notes + 113 chunks)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrated working semantic search across domains
- ‚úÖ Updated plan.md to reflect completed work
- ‚úÖ Suggested sync integration instead of separate watcher daemon

### Technical Insights
- **Document chunking enables granular search**: Can now find specific theorems or methods within papers
- **Embeddings in SQLite BLOBs work well**: No need for separate vector database at this scale
- **Sync integration better than daemon**: Simpler to add metadata update to existing chronicle sync

### Collapsi RL Update
Continued from yesterday's mixed evaluation implementation. The system now supports comparing raw neural network vs MCTS-enhanced versions of each model.

## üí° Ideas & Insights
- Consider adding metadata update to chronicle sync script: `python metadata_system/scripts/import_chronicle.py chronicle --new-only`
- Query API could use FastAPI for quick implementation
- RAG pipeline can leverage existing embeddings for context retrieval

## üìö Learning
- **Discovered**: OpenAI embeddings can be stored efficiently in SQLite as BLOB fields
- **Implemented**: Chunk-based retrieval improves search precision for academic content
- **Realized**: One-command workflow (sync + metadata) is better UX than separate daemon

## üîÑ Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Consider implementing Query API for Interactive CV
2. Design RAG pipeline architecture
3. Continue Collapsi RL model training

## üîó References
- OpenAI Embeddings API: text-embedding-3-small model
- SQLite BLOB storage for vector embeddings
- Cosine similarity for semantic search

**Reflection**: Productive day completing the core metadata infrastructure for the Interactive CV. The system now has a solid foundation with all data indexed, chunked, and embedded. Ready for the final RAG layer.

**Gratitude**: I'm grateful for having the OpenAI API credits to test the embedding system properly and see it work end-to-end.
