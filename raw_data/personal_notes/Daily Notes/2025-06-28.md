# Daily Note - 2025-06-28

## üéØ Today's Goals
- [x] Enhance Collapsi RL training with session timestamps and architecture preservation
- [x] Complete comprehensive academic paper analysis and enrichment project
- [x] Implement MCTS integration with PPO training
- [x] Fix all code diagnostics and type errors

## üìù Notes

### Morning Thoughts
Continued work on multiple projects with focus on Collapsi RL improvements and academic work analysis.

### Meetings & Calls
*No meetings today - deep work focus*

### Key Accomplishments
**Collapsi Project:**
- Implemented session timestamps for training checkpoints to prevent model mixing
- Added complete architecture preservation in checkpoints (no need to remember configurations)
- Created comprehensive model evaluation system with tournaments and heatmap visualizations
- Integrated Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with PPO training for enhanced gameplay
- Fixed all type checking and diagnostic issues across the codebase
- Rewrote README.md and updated CLAUDE.md documentation

**Academic Work Analysis:**
- Completed comprehensive analysis and enrichment of all academic papers
- Transformed basic summaries into 300+ line technical documents
- Added deep mathematical frameworks and theoretical implications
- Connected research to broader literature in optimal transport, control theory, and statistical mechanics
- Created publication-quality analyses suitable for graduate reference

**Interactive CV Project:**
- Set up initial repository with academic profiles and paper analyses
- Created comprehensive academic profile with research style and technical mastery sections
- Made initial git commit preserving all academic work

## üí° Ideas & Insights
- Session timestamps are crucial for preventing checkpoint confusion in long training runs #ml-engineering
- MCTS integration can add 200-400 Elo strength but at 50x computational cost #algorithms
- Monte Carlo returns work better than GAE for short-horizon games like Collapsi #rl-methods
- Systematic paper analysis methodology produces significantly better academic documentation #research-methods

## üìö Learning
- **Read**: MCTS implementation patterns for two-player games
- **Watched**: N/A
- **Discovered**: Terminal outcome prediction as auxiliary loss improves credit assignment in RL

## üîÑ Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Start comparative training runs: Standard PPO vs PPO+MCTS
2. Set up GitHub repository for interactive CV project
3. Begin frontend development for interactive CV presentation

- [[Collapsi RL Training Documentation]]
- [[Academic Paper Analysis Methodology]]
- MCTS integration code

**Reflection**: Productive day with major improvements to both Collapsi RL training system and academic documentation. The MCTS integration opens new possibilities for stronger gameplay while the academic analysis project reached completion with high-quality outputs.

**Gratitude**: I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on both technical implementations and academic documentation, bridging theoretical research with practical applications.
