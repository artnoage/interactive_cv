# Daily Note - 2025-06-27

## üéØ Today's Goals
- [x] Fix Collapsi game movement rules to allow direction changes
- [x] Implement proper pathfinding with DFS
- [x] Create polished web UI with multiple themes
- [x] Fix layout issues to fit everything on one screen

## üìù Notes

### Morning Thoughts
Started the day with a major misconception about the Collapsi game rules - thought movement was restricted to straight lines only. This led to a complete overhaul of the game logic.

### Meetings & Calls
Working session on Collapsi game development - discovered fundamental rule misunderstanding and implemented proper movement system.

### Key Accomplishments
- **Fixed Core Game Logic**: Rewrote `get_valid_moves()` to use DFS pathfinding allowing orthogonal movement with direction changes
- **Updated Backend API**: Modified endpoints to work with destination-based moves instead of path-based
- **Created Theme System**: Implemented 5 themes (Cyberpunk, Classic Board, Neon Nights, Minimalist, Retro Arcade) with localStorage persistence
- **UI Polish**: Removed confusing path visualization, fixed layout to fit on one screen, made responsive design

## üí° Ideas & Insights
- Allowing direction changes during movement makes the game significantly more strategic #game-design
- DFS pathfinding is computationally manageable for 4x4 board with max 4 moves #algorithms
- Simple click-to-destination UI is more intuitive than path building #ux-design
- Theme system adds nice personalization without complexity #user-experience

## üìö Learning
- **Read**: Game rules documentation (realized movement allows turns!)
- **Watched**: N/A
- **Discovered**: DFS with backtracking is perfect for small board pathfinding

## üîÑ Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Begin RL (Reinforcement Learning) implementation
2. Test game engine thoroughly with edge cases
3. Consider adding game statistics/analytics

## üîó References
- Collapsi game repository
- DFS pathfinding implementation

**Reflection**: Major breakthrough day - fixing the movement rules transformed the game from simple to strategically rich. The "aha" moment about direction changes was crucial.

**Gratitude**: I'm grateful for the clear correction about game rules that led to a much better implementation.
