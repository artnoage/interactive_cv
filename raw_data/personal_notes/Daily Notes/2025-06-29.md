# Daily Note - 2025-06-29

## üéØ Today's Goals
- [x] Continue Collapsi project enhancements
- [x] Implement RL training improvements
- [x] Complete academic paper analyses

## üìù Notes

### Morning Thoughts
Productive day working on multiple projects - Collapsi RL training system and academic CV enrichment.

### Meetings & Calls
*No meetings - deep technical work*

### Key Accomplishments
- Successfully refactored Collapsi RL training architecture into modular components
- Achieved breakthrough performance with mixed batch training (50.9-54.7% win rates)
- Completed comprehensive academic paper analyses for interactive CV project
- Fixed all diagnostics issues and improved code quality

## üí° Ideas & Insights
- Mixed batch training with checkpoint opponents proved more effective than pure self-play #rl-training
- Dynamic opponent pool evolution prevents training plateaus #adaptive-learning
- Monte Carlo returns work better than GAE for short-horizon games like Collapsi #rl-methods
- MCTS integration adds significant playing strength (200-400 Elo) at the cost of computation time #game-ai

## üìö Learning
- **Read**: Advanced RL techniques for board games, MCTS implementation patterns
- **Watched**: N/A
- **Discovered**: Modular architecture benefits for ML training systems, importance of diverse training opponents

## üîÑ Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Test the new dynamic opponent pool selection system
2. Run comparative experiments between standard PPO and PPO+MCTS
3. Begin interactive frontend development for CV project

## üîó References
- [[Collapsi RL Training Documentation]]
- [[Academic Paper Analysis Methodology]]
- MCTS implementation in collapsi_net.py

**Reflection**: Major architectural improvements to both Collapsi and the academic CV project. The modular refactoring of RL training components will make future development much cleaner and easier to test.

**Gratitude**: I'm grateful for the successful breakthroughs in training performance and the clean, well-organized codebase we've achieved.

## Technical Details Summary

### Collapsi RL Achievements
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns into collapsi_net.py, collapsi_env.py
- **Mixed Batch Training**: 50.9-54.7% win rates vs checkpoint opponents
- **Dynamic Opponent Pool**: Auto-selects top N strongest opponents
- **MCTS Integration**: Complete implementation with on/off flag
- **Session Management**: Timestamps prevent checkpoint mixing
- **Evaluation System**: Round-robin tournaments with heatmap visualization

### Academic CV Progress
- **300+ Line Analyses**: Transformed summaries into comprehensive documents
- **Mathematical Depth**: Added frameworks, theorems, proofs
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: Physics, ML, biology, economics connections
- **Publication Quality**: Graduate-level reference material
