  "title": "Daily Note - 2025-07-01",
  "summary": "Successfully completed core metadata system implementation for the Interactive CV project, including SQLite database setup, OpenAI API embedding integration, and semantic search functionality. This involved chunking academic papers and storing embeddings efficiently in SQLite. Also made progress on the Collapsi RL project.",

  "accomplishments": [
    "Completed Interactive CV metadata system implementation",
    "Implemented document chunking for academic papers",
    "Set up embeddings with OpenAI API",
    "Tested semantic search functionality",
    "Created comprehensive SQLite schema for documents, chunks, topics, people, projects, and document_chunks table",
    "Integrated OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model",
    "Stored embeddings as BLOBs in SQLite",
    "Implemented cosine similarity search at both document and chunk level",
    "Successfully tested semantic queries finding relevant academic sections and daily notes",
    "Maintained clean structure in metadata_system folder with single SQLite database",
    "Chunked all academic papers into 113 searchable sections",
    "Generated embeddings for all content (6 chronicle notes + 113 chunks)",
    "Demonstrated working semantic search across domains",
    "Updated plan.md to reflect completed work",
    "Continued Collapsi RL mixed evaluation implementation, now supporting comparison of raw neural network vs MCTS-enhanced versions of each model"

  "insights": [
    "Document chunking enables granular search: specific theorems or methods within papers can now be found",
    "Embeddings in SQLite BLOBs work well reducing the need for a separate vector database at this scale",
    "Sync integration is better than daemon: simpler to add metadata update to existing chronicle sync",
    "Consider adding metadata update to chronicle sync script for one-command workflow",
    "Query API could use FastAPI for quick implementation",
    "RAG pipeline can leverage existing embeddings for context retrieval"
  ],
  "learning": [
    "Discovered: OpenAI embeddings can be stored efficiently in SQLite as BLOB fields",
    "Implemented: Chunk-based retrieval improves search precision for academic content",
    "Realized: One-command workflow (sync + metadata) is better UX than separate daemon"
