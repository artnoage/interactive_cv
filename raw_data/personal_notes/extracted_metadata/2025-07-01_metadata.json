  "accomplishments": [
    "Completed Interactive CV metadata system implementation",
    "Implemented document chunking for academic papers",
    "Set up embeddings with OpenAI API",
    "Tested semantic search functionality",
    "Created comprehensive SQLite schema with documents, chunks, topics, people, projects",
    "Added document_chunks table for granular academic paper sections",
    "Integrated OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model",
    "Stored embeddings as BLOBs in SQLite",
    "Implemented cosine similarity search at both document and chunk level for semantic search",
    "Tested queries successfully finding relevant academic sections and daily notes",
    "Confirmed cross-domain search connects research papers with practical work",
    "Organized all data in a single SQLite database (`metadata_system/metadata.db`)",
    "Chunked all academic papers into 113 searchable sections",
    "Generated embeddings for all content (6 chronicle notes + 113 chunks)",
    "Demonstrated working semantic search across domains",
    "Updated plan.md to reflect completed work",
    "Suggested sync integration instead of separate watcher daemon",
    "Updated Collapsi RL system to support comparing raw neural network vs MCTS-enhanced versions."
  ],
  "insights": [
    "Document chunking enables granular search: Can now find specific theorems or methods within papers",
    "Embeddings in SQLite BLOBs work well: No need for separate vector database at this scale",
    "Sync integration better than daemon: Simpler to add metadata update to existing chronicle sync"
  ],
  "learning": [
    "Discovered OpenAI embeddings can be stored efficiently in SQLite as BLOB fields",
    "Implemented chunk-based retrieval improves search precision for academic content",
    "Realized one-command workflow (sync + metadata) is better UX than separate daemon"

  "challenges": [],
  "future_work": [
    "Consider implementing Query API for Interactive CV",
    "Design RAG pipeline architecture",
    "Continue Collapsi RL model training",
