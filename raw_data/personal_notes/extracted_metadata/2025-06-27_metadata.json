  "summary": "A productive day focused on overhauling the Collapsi game logic, specifically fixing movement rules to allow direction changes using DFS pathfinding, updating the backend API, and significantly polishing the web UI with multiple themes and improved responsiveness.",

  "accomplishments": [
    "Fixed core game logic by rewriting `get_valid_moves()` to use DFS pathfinding allowing orthogonal movement with direction changes",
    "Updated backend API to work with destination-based moves",
    "Implemented 5 themes (Cyberpunk, Classic Board, Neon Nights, Minimalist, Retro Arcade) with localStorage persistence",
    "Polished UI by removing confusing path visualization, fixing layout to fit on one screen, and making it responsive"
  ],
  "insights": [
    "Allowing direction changes during movement makes the game significantly more strategic",
    "DFS pathfinding is computationally manageable for 4x4 board with max 4 moves",
    "Simple click-to-destination UI is more intuitive than path building",
    "Theme system adds nice personalization without complexity"
  ],
  "learning": [
    "Game rules documentation (realized movement allows turns!)",
    "DFS with backtracking is perfect for small board pathfinding"
  ],
  "challenges": [
    "Initial misconception about Collapsi game movement rules"
  ],

    "Begin RL (Reinforcement Learning) implementation",
    "Test game engine thoroughly with edge cases",
