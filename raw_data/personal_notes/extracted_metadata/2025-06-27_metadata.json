  "summary": "A significant day for the Collapsi game development, focusing on correcting a fundamental misunderstanding of game rules, implementing proper DFS pathfinding, and polishing the UI with new themes. This led to a more strategic and intuitive game.",

  "accomplishments": [
    "Rewrote get_valid_moves() to use DFS pathfinding allowing orthogonal movement with direction changes",
    "Modified backend API endpoints to work with destination-based moves instead of path-based",
    "Implemented 5 themes (Cyberpunk, Classic Board, Neon Nights, Minimalist, Retro Arcade) with localStorage persistence",
    "Removed confusing path visualization",
    "Fixed UI layout to fit on one screen",
    "Made UI responsive design"
  ],
  "insights": [
    "Allowing direction changes during movement makes the game significantly more strategic",
    "DFS pathfinding is computationally manageable for 4x4 board with max 4 moves",
    "Simple click-to-destination UI is more intuitive than path building",
    "Theme system adds nice personalization without complexity"
  ],
  "learning": [
    "Learned game rules documentation (movement allows turns)",
    "Discovered DFS with backtracking is perfect for small board pathfinding"
  ],
  "challenges": [
    "Major misconception about the Collapsi game rules regarding movement restrictions"
  ],
