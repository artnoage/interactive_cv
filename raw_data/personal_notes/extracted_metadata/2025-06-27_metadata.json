  "summary": "A significant day was spent overhauling the core game logic for Collapsi due to a misunderstanding of movement rules, implementing proper DFS pathfinding and developing a robust theme system. This change made the game strategically richer.",

  "accomplishments": [
    "Fixed Core Game Logic: Rewrote get_valid_moves() to use DFS pathfinding allowing orthogonal movement with direction changes",
    "Updated Backend API: Modified endpoints to work with destination-based moves instead of path-based",
    "Created Theme System: Implemented 5 themes (Cyberpunk, Classic Board, Neon Nights, Minimalist, Retro Arcade) with localStorage persistence",
    "UI Polish: Removed confusing path visualization, fixed layout to fit on one screen, made responsive design"
  ],
  "insights": [
    "Allowing direction changes during movement makes the game significantly more strategic",
    "DFS pathfinding is computationally manageable for 4x4 board with max 4 moves",
    "Simple click-to-destination UI is more intuitive than path building",
    "Theme system adds nice personalization without complexity",
    "A major breakthrough was fixing the movement rules, transforming the game from simple to strategically rich.",
    "The \"aha\" moment about direction changes was crucial."
  ],
  "learning": [
    "Read: Game rules documentation (realized movement allows turns!)",
    "Discovered: DFS with backtracking is perfect for small board pathfinding"
  ],
  "challenges": [
    "Started the day with a major misconception about the Collapsi game rules - thought movement was restricted to straight lines only. This led to a complete overhaul of the game logic."
  ],
  "future_work": [
    "Begin RL (Reinforcement Learning) implementation",
    "Test game engine thoroughly with edge cases",
    "Consider adding game statistics/analytics"
