# MCP Sequential Thinking Experiment

This is an isolated experiment implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with a **Sequential Thinking** tool. The implementation includes both an MCP server and client, demonstrating how agents can use structured thinking processes.

## üéØ Overview

This experiment creates:
- **MCP Server**: Provides a `sequential_thinking` tool for structured problem-solving
- **MCP Client**: Connects to MCP servers and uses their tools
- **Thinking Agent**: High-level agent that uses sequential thinking to solve complex problems

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Test the Basic Client

```bash
cd mcp_experiment
python client/mcp_client.py
```

This will:
- Start the MCP server
- Connect as a client
- Run a sequential thinking session on a marketing problem
- Display the thinking process step by step

### 2. Run the Thinking Agent Demo

```bash
cd mcp_experiment
python examples/thinking_agent.py
```

This will run multiple demos:
- Marketing Strategy Problem
- Technical Architecture Problem  
- Business Strategy Problem

Each demo showcases different aspects of sequential thinking.

## üîß Components

### MCP Server (`sequential_thinking_server.py`)

The server implements:
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** protocol for MCP communication
- **Sequential Thinking Engine** that manages thought sequences
- **Branching** support for exploring alternative solutions
- **Revision** capability for refining previous thoughts

**Key Features:**
- Tracks thought sequences with timestamps
- Supports branching into alternative reasoning paths
- Allows revision of previous thoughts
- Maintains thinking summaries

### MCP Client (`mcp_client.py`)

The client provides:
- **Asynchronous communication** with MCP servers
- **Tool discovery** and invocation
- **High-level sequential thinking interface**
- **Error handling** and connection management

**Key Features:**
- Connects to MCP servers via subprocess
- Handles JSON-RPC protocol automatically
- Provides easy-to-use sequential thinking methods

### Thinking Agent (`thinking_agent.py`)

The agent demonstrates:
- **Problem-solving** using sequential thinking
- **Alternative exploration** through branching
- **Thought revision** for refinement
- **Domain-specific** thinking patterns

**Key Features:**
- Automatically generates contextual thoughts
- Supports different problem domains (marketing, technical, business)
- Provides branching and revision capabilities

## üìã Sequential Thinking Tool

The `sequential_thinking` tool accepts these parameters:

### Required Parameters
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed

### Optional Parameters
- `isRevision` (boolean): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer): Which thought is being reconsidered
- `branchFromThought` (integer): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean): If more thoughts are needed

## üé≠ Example Usage

### Basic Sequential Thinking

```python
from mcp_client import SequentialThinkingClient

client = SequentialThinkingClient(["python", "server/sequential_thinking_server.py"])
await client.start()

# First thought
result = await client.think(
    "I need to analyze the problem requirements",
    next_thought_needed=True,
    total_thoughts=5
)

# Second thought
result = await client.think(
    "Now I should consider different solution approaches",
    next_thought_needed=True,
    total_thoughts=5
)
```

### Branching Alternative Solutions

```python
# Branch from thought 2 to explore alternatives
result = await client.think(
    "Let me explore a different approach",
    next_thought_needed=True,
    total_thoughts=3,
    branch_from_thought=2,
    branch_id="alternative_1"
)
```

### Revising Previous Thoughts

```python
# Revise thought 3 with new insights
result = await client.think(
    "Actually, I should reconsider this approach based on new information",
    next_thought_needed=False,
    total_thoughts=5,
    is_revision=True,
    revises_thought=3
)
```

## üß™ Testing

The implementation includes several test scenarios:

1. **Marketing Strategy**: 7-step thinking process for product launch
2. **Technical Architecture**: 6-step system design process
3. **Business Strategy**: 8-step international expansion planning

Each test demonstrates different aspects of sequential thinking.

## üîç Key Benefits

1. **Structured Problem Solving**: Breaks complex problems into manageable steps
2. **Alternative Exploration**: Supports branching for different approaches
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Allows revision of previous thoughts
4. **Transparency**: Provides clear thinking process visibility
5. **Scalability**: Works with problems of varying complexity

## üîß Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

The implementation uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** over **stdio** for MCP communication:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
        "name": "sequential_thinking",
        "arguments": {
            "thought": "My current thinking step",
            "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
            "thoughtNumber": 1,
            "totalThoughts": 5
        }
    }
}
```

### State Management

The server maintains:
- **Thought sequences** with timestamps
- **Branch tracking** for alternative paths
- **Revision history** for thought refinements
- **Progress tracking** for completion status

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- asyncio support
- JSON-RPC 2.0 compatible environment

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **LLM Integration**: Use LLMs to generate contextual thoughts
- **Persistence**: Save thinking sessions to disk
- **Visualization**: Web interface for thought graphs
- **Collaboration**: Multi-agent thinking sessions
- **Templates**: Pre-defined thinking patterns for common problems

## üìö MCP Integration Patterns

This experiment demonstrates key MCP patterns:

1. **Server Implementation**: Tool registration and execution
2. **Client Implementation**: Server communication and tool usage
3. **Agent Integration**: High-level problem-solving workflows
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery
5. **Async Communication**: Non-blocking client-server interaction
