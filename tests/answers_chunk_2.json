      "expected_answer": "Both methods face significant computational challenges but of different natures. UNOT's training is computationally expensive (35 hours on an H100 GPU) due to the large number of samples and forward/backward passes through the Fourier Neural Operator, though inference is extremely fast. The Assignment Method has O(mN) complexity per assigner step, requiring finding the minimum cost assignment over all N real points for each of m generated points, making it impractical for large datasets. Both represent trade-offs between flexibility/generality and computational cost.",

      "expected_answer": "Vaios implemented DFS (Depth-First Search) pathfinding with backtracking for the Collapsi game. He realized that DFS with backtracking is perfect for small board pathfinding on the 4x4 board with a maximum of 4 moves. This allowed the game to support orthogonal movement with direction changes, making it significantly more strategic than the initial implementation which had misconceptions about the movement rules.",

      "expected_answer": "Key mathematical concepts that appear across Vaios's papers include: Optimal Transport (appearing in both UNOT and GAN training papers), Wasserstein distances (W1 and W2 metrics), dual formulations and Kantorovich duality, push-forward measures, cost functions, and measure theory. These reflect his deep expertise in optimal transport theory and its applications to machine learning, spanning from theoretical foundations to practical implementations in neural networks and generative models.",

      "expected_answer": "Vaios made several UI improvements to Collapsi: removed confusing path visualization, fixed layout to fit on one screen, made it responsive, implemented a three-column layout with enlarged game board, added 5 themes with localStorage persistence (Cyberpunk, Classic Board, Neon Nights, Minimalist, Retro Arcade), changed to simple click-to-destination UI which is more intuitive than path building, and added creator attribution with tutorial video by Mark S. Ball.",

      "expected_answer": "UNOT uses a self-supervised bootstrapping technique where the model generates its own targets. The solver network predicts a dual potential, then a target is created by running a few Sinkhorn iterations initialized with the solver's own prediction. Proposition 5 proves that minimizing the L2 loss between the predicted potential and the k-step bootstrapped target provides an upper bound for the L2 loss against the true ground truth potential, using the contraction property of the Sinkhorn operator in the Hilbert projective metric. This avoids needing pre-computed ground-truth solutions.",
