      "expected_answer": "The Assignment Method, developed by Vaios Laschos, Jan Tinapp, and Klaus Obermayer, enables generative networks to be trained by minimizing the optimal transport distance for any arbitrary, user-specified cost function, not just the Wasserstein-1 metric used in traditional WGANs. It uses an auxiliary 'assigner' network that learns the dual potential by balancing assignments between generated and real data, effectively decoupling the training process from the constraints of the Wasserstein-1 metric. This allows for more flexible, domain-specific cost functions like SSIM for better perceptual quality.",

The core innovation was approximating the utility function as a sum of exponentials and introducing a multivariate information state vector, where each component corresponds to an exponential term.

      "expected_answer": "Both methods face significant computational challenges but of different natures. UNOT's training is computationally expensive (35 hours on an H100 GPU) due to the large number of samples and forward/backward passes through the Fourier Neural Operator, though inference is extremely fast. The Assignment Method has O(mN) complexity per assigner step, requiring finding the minimum cost assignment over all N real points for each of m generated points, making it impractical for large datasets.

He realized that DFS with backtracking is perfect for small board pathfinding on the 4x4 board with a maximum of 4 moves. This allowed the game to support orthogonal movement with direction changes, making it significantly more strategic than the initial implementation which had misconceptions about the movement rules.",

      "expected_answer": "UNOT uses a self-supervised bootstrapping technique where the model generates its own targets. The solver network predicts a dual potential, then a target is created by running a few Sinkhorn iterations initialized with the solver's own prediction. Proposition 5 proves that minimizing the L2 loss between the predicted potential and the k-step bootstrapped target provides an upper bound for the L2 loss against the true ground truth potential, using the contraction property of the Sinkhorn operator in the Hilbert projective metric. This avoids needing pre-computed ground-truth solutions.",

      "expected_answer": "Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) are neural network architectures that learn mappings between function spaces. They are discretization-invariant because they perform key operations in Fourier space, making them suitable for learning to solve problems on grids of varying resolutions. UNOT uses FNOs as the solver network S_phi because they can generalize across measures of different resolutions (from 10x10 to 64x64 in experiments), which was a key requirement for creating a universal solver that works across different datasets and resolutions.",

He fixed this by extracting MCTS into a standalone module and ensuring proper instance management. He also extracted common evaluation logic, reducing approximately 40 lines of duplicate code, created a centralized state preparation helper function, and achieved 60-70% file size reduction through ONNX conversion for the AI models.",

This pattern appears in his Collapsi implementation where he chose DFS for the 4x4 board (manageable complexity) and used ONNX for 60-70% model size reduction, showing his consistent approach to balancing theoretical optimality with practical constraints.",

He noted that if the policy truly understands good moves, it should implicitly understand position values, and a persistent gap indicates potential for improvement.

      "expected_answer": "In the GAN paper, 'assignment' refers to the mathematical concept of assigning generated data points to real data points to minimize transport cost, with the assigner network learning optimal assignments for the dual OT problem. In his game development, assignment appears more practically - he assigns themes to UI elements, assigns moves to valid positions via DFS pathfinding, and assigns policies to game states via MCTS.
