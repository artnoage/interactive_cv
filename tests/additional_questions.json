      "question": "How does Vaios's theoretical work on Wasserstein gradient flows directly relate to modern diffusion models?",
      "expected_answer": "Vaios's deep theoretical work on Wasserstein gradient flows and Evolutionary Variational Inequalities (EVIs) directly prefigured and provides a rigorous foundation for understanding modern diffusion models (DDPMs, score-based models). His PhD thesis was specifically on Wasserstein gradient flows and thermodynamic limits, and he has expertise in gradient flow theory including De Giorgi and JKO schemes applied to spaces of measures. This mathematical foundation is crucial for diffusion models, which are fundamentally based on gradient flows in probability space.",

      "question": "How does Vaios's track record demonstrate his ability to translate theoretical advances into practical ML implementations for diffusion models?",
      "expected_answer": "Vaios has a proven track record of translating theory to practice: he developed novel mathematical frameworks (Hellinger-Kantorovich spaces) and connected them to computational problems, applied optimal transport theory to train GANs with arbitrary transport costs, developed neural network solvers for OT (UNOT at ICML 2025), and has hands-on experience training and fine-tuning LLMs up to 32B parameters. His profile explicitly states he's 'now focused on translating this deep theoretical knowledge into building and training advanced agentic AI systems,' showing his commitment to practical implementation.",

      "expected_answer": "Vaios combines deep expertise in Stochastic Analysis & McKean-Vlasov Equations with practical experience in Diffusion Models & Score-Based Methods. His research on Large Deviation Principles and Brownian Motion provides the probabilistic foundations essential for diffusion models, while his hands-on experience training LLMs, fine-tuning models up to 32B parameters, and developing generative models gives him the practical implementation skills. This rare combination of rigorous mathematical foundations in stochastic processes with cutting-edge ML implementation experience makes him uniquely positioned to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of diffusion models.",
