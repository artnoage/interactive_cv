It uses an auxiliary 'assigner' network that learns the dual potential by balancing assignments between generated and real data, effectively decoupling the training process from the constraints of the Wasserstein-1 metric. This allows for more flexible, domain-specific cost functions like SSIM for better perceptual quality.",

The solver network predicts a dual potential, then a target is created by running a few Sinkhorn iterations initialized with the solver's own prediction. Proposition 5 proves that minimizing the L2 loss between the predicted potential and the k-step bootstrapped target provides an upper bound for the L2 loss against the true ground truth potential, using the contraction property of the Sinkhorn operator in the Hilbert projective metric.

In his game development, assignment appears more practically - he assigns themes to UI elements, assigns moves to valid positions via DFS pathfinding, and assigns policies to game states via MCTS.

His research on Large Deviation Principles and Brownian Motion provides the probabilistic foundations essential for diffusion models, while his hands-on experience training LLMs, fine-tuning models up to 32B parameters, and developing generative models gives him the practical implementation skills. This rare combination of rigorous mathematical foundations in stochastic processes with cutting-edge ML implementation experience makes him uniquely positioned to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of diffusion models.",
