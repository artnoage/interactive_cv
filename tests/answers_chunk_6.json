      "expected_answer": "The primary focus of the daily note on 2025-06-30 was refactoring the Collapsi project into a standalone web application, integrating AI with ONNX, improving code quality, and implementing AlphaZero-style training. A key insight regarding AlphaZero training was that AlphaZero policy loss can decrease while value loss remains high, suggesting policy might be memorizing MCTS patterns without true understanding.",
