This assigner learns the optimal transport (OT) potential by balancing assignments between generated and real data. The generator is then trained to minimize this OT cost.\n\nTraditional WGANs (Wasserstein GANs) also utilize optimal transport, specifically the Wasserstein-1 distance, to measure the distance between the real and generated data distributions. However, the Assignment Method introduces a distinct approach to learning this transport cost through an explicit \"assigner\" network that balances assignments. This suggests a different mechanism for enforcing the Lipschitz constraint or approximating the Earth Mover's Distance compared to the weight clipping or gradient penalty methods typically employed in WGANs.",

His paper \"Wasserstein gradient flows from large deviations of thermodynamic limits\" showcases this step.\n\nThe most prominent example of this evolution is his work on **Universal Neural Optimal Transport** and \"Training Generative Networks with Arbitrary Optimal Transport costs.\" These titles directly point to the application of optimal transport theory, a field rooted in the mathematical concepts he previously explored, to the development and training of generative artificial intelligence models. This shows a direct link from abstract mathematical research to practical AI solutions.\n\nWhile I don't have direct access to his personal work notes, if he has documented his \"LLM Training\" or \"Agentic Systems Development\" processes, these would further solidify the trajectory from theoretical mathematical research to hands-on AI application development.",
